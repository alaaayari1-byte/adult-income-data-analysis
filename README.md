# Adult Income Data Analysis (Python & Pandas)

## 🚀 Project Summary 

This project demonstrates my ability to perform **end-to-end data analysis** using **Python and Pandas**, from raw data cleaning to exploratory data analysis (EDA). The project is designed as a **portfolio-ready project** to showcase practical data analysis skills relevant to **Data Analyst / Junior Data Scientist** roles.

The dataset analyzed is the well-known **Adult Income (Census Income) dataset**, commonly used in real-world data analysis and machine learning tasks.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Load and explore a real-world dataset
* Clean and preprocess raw data
* Analyze relationships between demographic features and income
* Prepare the dataset for future machine learning modeling

---

## 📂 Dataset Information

* **Name:** Adult Income Dataset (Census Income)
* **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository
* **Target Variable:** `salary` (<=50K, >50K)
* **Type:** Structured tabular data

### Features Analyzed

* Age
* Workclass
* Education & Education Level
* Marital Status
* Occupation
* Relationship
* Race & Sex
* Hours per Week
* Native Country
* Income (Target)

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Skills Demonstrated

* **Python**
* **Pandas** (data cleaning, transformation, analysis)
* **NumPy**
* **Jupyter Notebook**

### Data Analysis Skills

* Data loading & inspection
* Handling missing values
* String cleaning (trimming, formatting)
* Categorical data handling
* Feature understanding & preparation

---

## 🔍 Analysis Workflow

1. **Data Loading** using `pandas.read_csv()`
2. **Initial Exploration** (`head`, `info`, `describe`)
3. **Data Cleaning**

   * Removing unnecessary spaces
   * Handling missing and inconsistent values
   * Converting data types
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Income distribution analysis
   * Categorical feature analysis
   * Relationship between income and education, occupation, and working hours
5. **Feature Preparation** for potential modeling

---

## 📊 Key Findings

* Higher income is strongly correlated with **education level** and **occupation**
* Individuals working **more hours per week** tend to earn higher incomes
* Marital status and workclass show noticeable income patterns
